# tools-public installer — Claude Code slash commands from

#
# Install:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cppalliance/tools-public/master/install.sh | bash
#
# Uninstall (removes the same set, leaves your own commands alone):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cppalliance/tools-public/master/uninstall.sh | bash
#   # or:
#   UNINSTALL=1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cppalliance/tools-public/master/install.sh | bash
#
# Re-run install to update to the latest versions; existing files are overwritten.
# Env knobs:
#   INSTALL_YES=1   skip the [y/N] confirmation
#   UNINSTALL=1     remove instead of install
#   DEST=/path      override ~/.claude/commands
#   SKILL_DEST=a:b  override the skill install roots (colon-separated)
#   LOCAL_SRC=/path use a local checkout instead of downloading the tarball

tools-public — Claude Code slash commands and skills
====================================================

A curated set of prompt-based "tools" from github.com/cppalliance/tools-public.
Each command is a markdown prompt invoked via /<name> inside Claude Code,
covering code review, document tightening, plan refinement, persona voices,
adaptive interviews, tutorials, and more.

Skills are directory-based tools that ship scripts alongside the prompt. They
install to both Claude Code and Cursor, which share the SKILL.md format.
